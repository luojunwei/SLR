Scaffolder: SLR
=================

1) Introduction
```
	SLR is an scaffolder which aims to determine the orientations and orders of contigs. 
	The contigs can be produced by any assembler.
	The input data of SLR is the long reads (fasta format) and the contigs.
```
2) Before installing and running
	First, Please build and install Samtools and Bamtools. And add enviroment vairable BAMTOOLS_HOME which is the path of bamtools.

3) Installing.
```
	SLR should run on Linux operating sysetm with gcc. We test SLR using gcc4.6.3 on Ubuntu.
	Create a main directory (eg:SLR). Copy all source code to this directory.
	cd SLR
	export BAMTOOLS_HOME=/path_bamtools/
	make
```
4) Running.
```
	Run command line: 
	bwa index contigs.fasta
	bwa mem -k11 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0 -a -Y contigs.fasta longreads.fasta > aligning.sam
	samtools view -Sb aligning.sam > aligning.bam
	SLR -c <contigs.fa> -r <aligning.bam> -p <output_directory> -m <minimum_contig_length> -n <minimum_read_length>
	<contigs.fa>: 
		The file includes contigs produced by one assembler.
	<aligning.bam>:
		The aligning result between the contigs and the long reads.
	<output_directory>:
		The directory of scaffolding result.
	<minimum_contig_length>: 
		The contigs whose lengthes are larger than minimum_contig_length will be used for scaffolding.
	<minimum_read_length>: 
		The long reads whose lengthes are larger than minimum_read_length will be used for scaffolding.
```
